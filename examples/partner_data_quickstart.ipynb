    "# Get Started with Data for Good Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes you have already followed the steps [here](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/dais-2025-genai-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#1-set-up-your-workspace-and-get-data) to set up your workspace and send your Delta Sharing ID to request the partner data. It might take some time for the data to show up in the Delta Sharing section of your workspace. Once it is there, [add it as a catalog so you can use it in your workspace](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/dais-2025-genai-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#accessing-the-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have access to three schemas:\n",
    "- `bright_initiative`\n",
    "- `mimilabs`\n",
    "- `nimble`\n",
    "\n",
    "with the data provided by each of these organizations.\n",

    "## How to Use This Guide\n",
    "The goal of this guide is to help you with the first steps of accessing these data and using them with AI tools. Your actual projects will most likely not look like these examples, but we hope showing how to start working with the data will help you get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Approach\n",
    "1. Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/dais-2025-genai-hackathon?tab=readme-ov-file#1-set-up-your-workspace-and-get-data) to set up your workspace and get the data.\n",
    "2. Pick a theme or challenge you are interested in.\n",
    "3. Spend some time [exploring the data](#exploring-the-data) with AI/BI Genie spaces.\n",
    "4. Determine what your application needs to do with the data in order to solve the challenge you have chosen to pursue.\n",
    "5. Pick the framework or tools that are the best fit for your application.\n",
    "6. Build!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To start exploring the data, we recommend creating one or more [AI/BI Genie Spaces](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie). Genie spaces let you ask natural language questions about the data you're interested in and get SQL queries, answers, and visualizations in return. It is a great way to quickly get up to speed on new data. You can access AI/BI Genie in the left sidebar in the `SQL` section.\n"

    "\n",
    "To expand on this approach and make it more suitable for your project, consider:\n",
    "- Letting the agent write the SQL for you, which allows it to answer flexible questions like \"are there any listings with a pool?\" without you needing to write a new query for every possible feature.\n",
    "- Combining keyword search with structured data for more powerful retrieval, so you can find reviews that mention \"spacious\" but only for listings with a guest rating above 4.8.\n",
    "- Giving your agent multiple \"tools\" to choose from, such as one function to query the Airbnb data and another to fetch live hotel prices from a different partner's API.\n",
    "- Integrate with other Bright data sources for a more holistic view of neighborhood accessibility, or for comparisons with other lodging options such as hotels.\n",
